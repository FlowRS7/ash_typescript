# Legacy Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been archived as part of the documentation restructuring initiative (2025-07-16).

## Archived Files

| Archived File | Replaced By | Reason for Archive |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `ai-architecture-patterns.md` | [ai-implementation-guide.md](../ai-implementation-guide.md) | Content consolidated into comprehensive implementation guide |
| `ai-development-workflow.md` | [ai-implementation-guide.md](../ai-implementation-guide.md) | Workflow patterns integrated into implementation guide |
| `ai-domain-knowledge.md` | [ai-implementation-guide.md](../ai-implementation-guide.md) | Domain knowledge consolidated into implementation guide |
| `ai-embedded-resources.md` | [ai-implementation-guide.md](../ai-implementation-guide.md) | Embedded resource patterns integrated into implementation guide |

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files were moved to legacy as part of a documentation optimization effort to:

1. **Reduce Context Window Usage**: Large files (500-1000+ lines) consume excessive AI assistant context space
2. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Significant content overlap between these files and `ai-implementation-guide.md`
3. **Improve Discoverability**: Consolidate related information into focused, comprehensive files
4. **Maintain Current Information**: Ensure AI assistants read the most up-to-date implementation patterns

## Current Documentation Structure

For current documentation, refer to:

- **[docs/ai-index.md](../ai-index.md)** - Master index for finding relevant documentation
- **[ai-implementation-guide.md](../ai-implementation-guide.md)** - Comprehensive implementation patterns and architecture
- **[ai-troubleshooting.md](../ai-troubleshooting.md)** - Debugging and troubleshooting procedures
- **[ai-quick-reference.md](../ai-quick-reference.md)** - Quick commands and common patterns
- **[ai-validation-safety.md](../ai-validation-safety.md)** - Testing and safety procedures

## Future Plans

These archived files will be processed in Phase 2-4 of the documentation restructuring:

- **Phase 2**: Break down large files into focused topic files (200-400 lines each)
- **Phase 3**: Create task-specific quick guides
- **Phase 4**: Create reference cards and update cross-references

## Access Policy

**Do not read these archived files.** They contain outdated information and patterns that may conflict with current implementation approaches. Always use the current documentation listed above.
