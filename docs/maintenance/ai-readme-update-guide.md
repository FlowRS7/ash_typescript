## AshTypescript-Specific Guidelines

### Project Title and Description

**Title**: Should be clear and memorable
```markdown
# AshTypescript

A library for generating TypeScript types and RPC clients from Ash resources and actions.
```

**Description**: Expand on the value proposition
```markdown
AshTypescript provides automatic TypeScript type generation for your Ash APIs, ensuring end-to-end type safety between your Elixir backend and TypeScript frontend. Generate type-safe RPC clients, validate API contracts, and catch integration errors at compile time.
```

### Installation Section

**Must Include**:
- Mix dependency configuration
- Required Elixir/Ash versions
- Any additional setup steps

**Template**:
```markdown
## Installation

Add `ash_typescript` to your dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ash_typescript, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

**Requirements:**
- Elixir ~> 1.15
- Ash ~> 3.5
- AshPhoenix ~> 2.0 (for RPC endpoints)
```

### Quick Start Section

**Critical Requirements**:
- Complete, working example
- Copy-paste ready code
- Shows immediate value
- Takes under 5 minutes to implement

**Template**:
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Add the RPC extension to your domain:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Domain do
  use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshTypescript.Rpc]
  
  rpc do
    resource MyApp.Todo do
      rpc_action :list_todos, :read
      rpc_action :create_todo, :create
    end
  end
end
```

2. **Generate TypeScript types:**

```bash
mix ash_typescript.codegen --output "assets/js/ash_rpc.ts"
```

3. **Use in your TypeScript code:**

```typescript
import { listTodos, createTodo } from './ash_rpc';

const todos = await listTodos({
  fields: ["id", "title", "completed"]
});
```
```
