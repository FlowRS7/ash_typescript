# Rules for working with ash_typescript project

In order to generate the typescript code for the test setup, run the following command:

```bash
mix test.codegen
```

In order to compile the generated code, run the following commands:


```bash
cd test/ts
npm run compile
```

This will compile both `generated.ts` and `typeTests.ts` in the `test/ts` directory.

Any compilation errors will be reported in the console.
